                        <p>It's been a month since we met. A lot of things happened and it's been a roller coaster ride. I'm glad I met an amazing person like you. Some people might say na mabilis or what but I really enjoy being with you, even if we just sat there in silence, I'll still enjoy it because I'm with you.</p>

Nagising na lang ako na hinihintay ka or mga chat mo. I am thrilled to know what happened sa day mo. You make my heart beat fast and you also make me feel at peace.</p>

                        <p>I'll forever be thankful that the universe let me meet you. I won't change anything in my past if it'll lead me to you. I don't have much to offer, Luisse, and I can't give you everything but you'll have all of me. We have so much ahead of us but I'm willing to go through it all with you. I love you so much, My Luisse Elizabeth â™¥</p>
